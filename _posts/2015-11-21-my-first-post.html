<p>During the summer of 2012 Tereza and I got an itch to own a sailboat. We had no sailing experience but agreed that the best way to get some was by DOING IT! At the time, we were living near one of Colorado's largest bodies of water, Blue Mesa - a man made lake just above 8,000 feet of elevation. Usually you don't think of sailing at 8,000 ft but it turned out to be a great place to learn. Other than the erratic mountain winds, it was a forgiving place to sail - no big swells or currents to deal with, no pirates, and the shore was always within swimming distance. So our hunt for a boat began. It didn't take long. If I remember correctly it was within weeks that we came across a sailboat for sale while driving to a music festival. The boat looked to be worthy but then again we didn't know what we were looking for. We took a chance on the little blue sail boat and on our way back from the festival we were with the boat in tow...very slowly climbing over mountain passes.</p>
<p>The first thing I learned about sailing that summer was that a sail boat is just a hole in the water that you throw money into. That's what several boat owners told me when they found out I was now "part of the club". That first summer our little blue never touched the water. As I found out, from more experienced sailors examining our new hole in the water, that the boat was missing about half of its rigging and had some serious rot happening around the portholes. Eager to get my hands dirty and sticky (working with fiberglass is kind of like tar and feathers) I started gutting the inside of the boat and eradicating all the rot that I could get too. The material costs along with the hardware and custom rigging was going to set us back more than we could afford. So we did what we could that summer and put the rest off until the following year. Needless to say our dream of learning how to sail took a lot more work and money than we anticipated. But we learned important lessons and new skills that are essential for any boat owner.</p>

<p>It was a tremendous feeling to finally see little blue floating. Just the fact that she was not sinking was a huge relieve. After a dozen or so sails we really started to get the hang of it. It's plain sailing when the conditions are just right. For the most part, it's is pretty intuitive once you get a feel for the boat and the physics of sailing. It truly is an amazing feeling to see your boat quietly gliding over the calm waters and its big beautiful sails full of wind. For us it was the sense of freedom and adventure that hooked us. Our desires for sailing started to quickly out grow our little vessel and the confines of the lake. So we dreamt of bigger boats and larger bodies of water.</p>

<p>One day while surfing the web I came across a networking site that connected sailboat captains with crews. So out of curiosity I signed up and created a profile. What I discovered, was a vast network of sailboat owners around the globe looking for people to join them on adventures. This was our ticket to go bigger, an opportunity to test the waters and get the <em>real</em> sailing experience. The timing was perfect. I had just got accepted to the Turing School of Software Development and Design. The plan was to quit our jobs, rent our place, and head out on an adventure before starting at Turing. We were already heading to Europe for a couple of months so we focused on the Adriatic Sea, specifically along the Croatian coast. Croatia has a long stretch of mountainous coastlines that overlook a thousand or so islands. In combination with the beautiful landscapes and the historic towns and cities that dot the coast, it seemed like the perfect place for a sailing adventure.
<p>Some people, like my parents, have this preconceived notion of sailors as an odd bunch, that live off shore because they don't fit in ashore. So naturally my parents thought we were crazy to join a random lonely sailor in a far off country. The truth is that there is very little privacy and personal space on a sailboat. At times situations can get intense and personality conflicts can get in the way. And by the time you figure out that the captain is a drunken, deranged sailor its probably too late - you're a sitting duck out on the sea. This is not what I was imagining but something, I'm sure, my parents were thinking when I told them what we were up to. The funny thing is that most sailors are probably offshore to escape the insanity of life ashore. They tend to be more laid back and generally happy because they are living their dream. That was definitely true for the Captain that we found.</p>
<p>His name was Tom and he was from South Africa. A tall man build like a rugby player that had dabbled in farming, raised a family of four, and recently retired from an IT job in England. Tom spent most of his life around the ocean, either swimming, surfing, or sailing. His boat was a 42 foot Benneteau that he named "Swing". It had three cabins (sleeping quarters), three heads (toilets) with showers, and a large galley (the kitchen).</p>
<p>When we initially reached out to Tom about joining him for a few weeks he said that the timing was perfect, he would be wrapping up a sailing trip to Haiti. So with some verbal commitments in several email correspondences we bought our plane tickets and made some arrangements for getting to the boat. He didn't give us an itinerary or a real objective other than just going where ever the wind takes us.</p>
<p>Two weeks before our scheduled meeting with Tom we get an email that he was going to be delayed a week because of mechanical issues on the boat he was crewing to Haiti. "Sorry" he said, "I hope you can find something to do in Croatia for a week". So we studied the map and looked at our options. It was about 160 miles south along the coast from where we would be starting and a couple of island hops to get to the island of Lastovo where Tom and his boat would be waiting. What we originally planned would only take half a day, now had to take a whole week. The extra transportaion costs and accommodation was not in the budget. So we decided to pack a tent and use our thumb to get around. Everything went smoothly. We met some wonderful people that went out of their way to help us. Some taught us Croatian words, some talked politics, some talked Croatian history, and others actually invited us to stay with them. We learned so much about Croatians and their culture. We got to experience some amazing places and tried foods and drinks that we might have never known about. By the time we met Tom we felt enculturated and educated. We were so pleased with how it had worked out. We were given an opportunity to see Croatia from both the land and the sea</p><img id="zadar" src="http://s8.postimg.org/idlaui2pt/Full_Size_Render_28.jpg?noCache=1453960326" alt="Zadar, Croatia">

<p>Tom was a pleasure to be around. He welcomed us with open arms and he seemed genuinely happy to share his boat with us. We spent the first day with Tom just getting the boat rigged. "Swing" was a different beast compared to our little boat. The scale of its hardware was so much bigger than what I was use to. It had sophisticated instruments, radios, safety gear, twice the rigging and so much more. It was also way more spacious and comfortable. We couldn't wait to hoist the sails and feel the freedom of sailing and the vastness of the sea. On the second day we went for a test run to see that everything was working properly and to get us familiar with the systems. The wind was blowing about 15-20 knots and the swells were about 5-10 feet...enough to knock you around and make you sea sick. For Tom it was nothing but we were both gripped and feeling very green. Eventually we eased up and sank into the peaceful warmth of the sun and the silence and the beauty of the emerald-tinged blue of the Adriatic Sea. Before we knew it, Tom was passing the helm over to us, giving us a sense of how well "Swing" handles and responds to our touch. She was gracefully charging the waves and with confidence moving farther and farther from the shore. It had only been an hour or so and from where we started it was now just a speck in our wake.</p>
<p>To sum of the following two weeks it was mostly smooth sailing. When the wind was blowing we hopped from one island to the next. When we wanted some down time, we would explore old fishing villages by getting lost in the maze of little alleys that usually ended with amazing little restaurants and bars. When there wasn't a village to moor in we would drop anchor in remote bays and swim and snorkel for hours. Then it was usually salutes the end of the day with cheap wine or beer, a tradition Tom called "sundowners".  The trip was more relaxing than I imagined it would be. I guess we lucked out with great weather and moderate winds. I can't complain about that. However, I was looking for a little more action. I wanted to feel like I really survived something. I wanted to know what it really takes to be a sailor and if I am cut out for the job. I have heard of horror stories from the sea. That's not what I was asking for but I know that sailing isn't always as glorious as it sounds. Its the unpleasent times that test our character and prove weather we are really up for the challenge. It's a fact of life. We all deal with aspects of life that are not pleasant. Its what makes us really appreciate the brilliant beauty of the challenge and what it took to survive it. It's the sense of accomplishment. Its the satisfaction of knowing that you did it, that you endured and overcame. It is what makes us stronger, better, and appreciative of ourselves and life. So for now we continue to sail on those hopes and dreams that maybe one day we will cross, and survive, a great sailing adventure.</p> <p><em>"There are old sailors and there are bold sailor but very few old bold sailors".</em> </p>

<p>I recently started to explore the mythical text editor called vim. I use the word mythical because vim carries a reputation of being bizarre and scary to learn. At first glance, you probably wonder how this archaic and unapproachable beast is still today's top text editor. Compared to the slick and shiny new text editors like Atom and Sublime, which are easy to configure and use, vim out-of-the-box is a terrifying experience for any beginner. Did I mention that there is no mouse integration? This blog post is about how to get started with vim and to tell you that it's not as scary as you think. Although a big step from most text editors, it's easily doable and a worthwhile investment if you are going to be spending 8 hours a day writing and editing code.</p>
<p>The reason vim is so powerful is because it has a composable design, which means that with the stroke of just a few keys you can make large and quick edits. It's also modal which is another reason it's so efficient. Modal just means that it has other modes that you can switch between. This allows the user's fingers to never have to leave the keys. You can move the cursor, type text, edit, modify and navigate through your folders and files, all with keyboard commands. You can imagine if you are doing this all day long, how much time you save by not interrupting your work flow by taking your hands off of the keyboard to find the mouse or arrow keys. Although daunting to look at, the keyboard command schematic can give you an idea of how many commands you can use, there are literally a hundred or more. Here is a cheatsheet that I use to help me.<img src="http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif"></img>
<p>To get you started I have a few learning tools that I recommend. I am using the built-in vim 7.4 that comes with the Mac OS X 10.9. once you have vim installed type <em>vimtutor</em> on the command line. It's an interactive 20-30 minute tutorial that teaches you the fundamental commands and modes that you need for editing and navigating in vim. I found vimtutor to be very approachable and easy to use. The interface of vimtutor is pretty plain to look at, but it is very user friendly and what I like about it is that is gives you a playground to practice and perform the commands. Vimtutor is essential for any beginner.</p>

<p>Another fun tool is <a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">Vim -Adventures</a>. It's an online game that is described as "Zelda meets text editor." Its a interactive puzzle that forces you to only move a character around the board with only vim commands. I spent about 20 minutes before I got bored, but it was helpful for building command memorization. After an hour of vimtutor and vim adventures, you should be ready to start editing. Just find some old code that you can afford to play with and split the screen so you can have vim open in one window and reference a cheatsheet in another. Just play around and have fun with it.</p>
<p>Another thing that I want to mention is how "old school" the user interface looks when you first start up vim. Unlike the built-in colorful and sleek design of most text editors today, vim comes with a 70's looking interface. Although highly configurable, it's not user friendly. I found configuring vim to be the most intimidating part of the experience. You basically have to write code (vim script) to customize and configure your settings. You also have to install several third party plugins that are not as easy as just pushing a button like you would in atom. This all happens in the vimrc file. It's blank when you start but allows you to add your settings and plugins for customization. Of course you don't have to touch your vimrc file to use vim, but eventually you will want a color theme, syntax highlighting, special formatting, a file browser, and so on. To add some of these plugins you will want a package manager. I used <em>Vundle</em>, which stands for "vim bundle", because it was recommended to me and fairly easy to use. Here is a link to the installation and instructions <a href="http://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.Vim"></a>. Once you have vundle installed you can now add some awesome plugins. Here are a few key plugins that I started with:
  <ul>
    <li>Other than vundle, NERDtree is probably top on the list. This plugin allows you to travese you file system and visually see the file structure of a project with the ability to open those files. I dont always know what file I am looking for until I see it. So being able to see the names of folders and files makes searching easier for me.</li><img src="http://joelhooks.com/images/nerdtree.png"></img>
    <li>Another helpful searching plugin is Ctrlp. This is a fuzzy finder that gives you easy access to your files, buffers, and tags.</li>
    <li>Surround.vim is a fantastic plugin that makes it easy to surround things in parentheses, brackets, quotes, and html tags. You can add, change, and delete with simple key mappings.</li>
    <li>For my color scheme I use Solarize. You can use just about any color scheme you prefer but if you are interested solarize, checkout vim-colors-solarized.<img src="https://github.com/altercation/solarized/raw/master/img/solarized-yinyang.png"></img></li>
    <li>The last one that I will mention is vim-airline. This plugin gives you a status bar that is integrated with the powerline symbols. <img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/306502/995185/73fc7054-09b9-11e3-9d45-618406c6ed98.png"></img></li>
  </ul>

<p>There are two approaches to customization. One is look up what you want and slowly build your vimrc from scratch. This is easy to do for adding plugins, but when it comes to actually writing vim script its a different storyThis way you know what you have and understand what you are doing. The other approach is to just clone someone else's vimrc repo, and voila, it's all configured. However, you will most likely have no clue what you have or be able to understand what the individual pieces of code are doing. That said, I chose the latter because I was anxious to get it up and running.
  <p>If you are interested in a great vim customization, check out <a href="https://github.com/mcmire/vimfiles">Elliot Winkler's</a>. The important thing is to have something that you are excited to work with. I thought I would be almighty and build my vimrc file up from scratch like the "pros" but it's not easy to do and it takes time. I was afraid that just looking at the plain, colorless interface all the time, would deter me from wanting to use vim. However if you choose to start off with an already customized vimrc then I recommend getting in there and breaking shit. Comment out lines of code and then go back and see what changes. You will start to get a better sense of what is doing what. I have only been on the vim train for a few weeks now but I still get excited every time I open a project up in vim. I dont know if its just the novelty of learning something new but want I do know is there is so much to learn in vim and, I hope it keeps me engaged. They say once you switch to using vim it will be the last text editor you ever use.</p>

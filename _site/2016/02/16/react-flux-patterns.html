<h1 id="blogpost-title">What The Flux</h1>
<p id="blogpost-date">February 16, 2016</p>
<div class='content'>
<h3 class='section'>Introduction</h3>
  <p>The first time I heard the word Flux, in a technical sense, was during a
  talk about Redux. Ever since then I have asociated Flux with Redux and would
  use them interchangably, as if they were the same thing. To say they are the
  same would be like comparing MVC (Model, View, Controller) to Rails. Redux is
  a concrete implementation of a abstract concept that is called Flux. Flux is
  simply a architecture or pattern for a web application, much like the MVC is just
  a way to structure a Rails app.</p>
  <p>Flux was initially introduced by Facebook as a way to deal with derived
  data in very large applications. It encourages a single flow of data. It
  begins with a Action that is propogated in a view by a user. The Action
  is a object, containing data, that goes through a Dispatcher. The Dispatcher is
  like a traffic controller for the system and only allows one action to move
  through the system at a time. The Dispatcher sends the Action to a Store,
  which is the data layer where all the logic happens. Once something has been
  updated in the store, it sends the updated object or Action to the appropriate view, where it
  gets re-renderd.</p><br>

  <h3 class='section'>Structure and data flow</h3><br>
  <img id='flux-diagram' src='https://facebook.github.io/flux/img/flux-simple-f8-diagram-explained-1300w.png'>
  <p>The above diagram is central to the Flux pattern. The three main nodes,
  dispatcher, store, and views, are all independent and have thier own inputs
  and outputs. The action is simply the data that gets passed down the chain to
  be updated and re-rendered in the view. Lets take a closer look at each
  node</p><br>

  <h3 class='section'>View</h3>
  <p>The view is simply made up of components that render data. There are high
  level components that compose lower level components. The components can be
  stateful or stateless, meaning they can store information about changes or
  return the same data everytime. Components pass thier state as props to child
  components. In this pattern components do not depend on external mutable
  state. Components render only the data that they receive from their parent
  component. In this case we can think of components as pure functions. In other
  words it will return the same output if give the same input. This makes for
  very predictable code that is easy to reason with.</p><br>

  <h3 class='section'>Action</h3>
  <p>Actions are created in a view upon a user requesting a change in state. The
  view then wraps a helper method around a action, which delegates a
  call to a dispatcher method. An example of this might be when a user wants to
  update some text. In the view a event handler will be listening for a user
  interaction that wants to change some text. That handler will invoke a create
  action method like UpdateText(oldText, newText). It also adds a <i>type</i>
  to the action so the dispatcher can match it up to a callback.
  Actions can also come from servers. For instance when data is initialized or
  updated and when a server returns an error.</p><br>

  <h3 class='section'>Dispatcher</h3>
  <p>The dispacter in a flux app is a simple mechanism for managing the data
  flow of an action to a store. The dispatcher carries a map of key-value pairs.
  As an new action comes through the dispatcher, the dispatcher calls a method
  (dispatch) which takes the action <i>type</i> and iteraties over the map of
  callbacks and fires off each one associated with the action. The dispatcher
  becomes even more vital as the application grows and callbacks must be
  ordered and managed between other stores.</p><br>

  <h3 class='section'>Store</h3>
  <p>A dispatcher manages the flow of data, where as the store manages the state
  of that data. Similar to a model in a MVC, stores handle all the logic.
  However, unlike a model representing a single object, the store holds many
  objects. The store receives the data/action via a callback to the dispatcher.
  Again the action's <i>type</i> is used to determine what methods the store
  needs to update the state of the action. Once the update is done, the store
  broadcasts a message that say 'Hey if you are listening, my state has changed'.
  In reality, the store knows nothing about the view, only about the dispatcher
  and the action. However, its the responsibility of the view to always be listening
  for changes to the store, setting its state accordingly and then pushing those
  changes down the chain of its child components.</p>

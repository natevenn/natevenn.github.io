<h1 id="blogpost-title">Learning how to vim</h1>
<p id="blogpost-date">April 20, 2015</p>
<p>I recently started to explore the mythical text editor called Vim. Many people fear the vim for various reasons - The vast number of commands that have to be memorized, no mouse integration, manual management of files and vim out of the box just has basic functionality and compared to most IDEs the UI is ugly to look at. But that can all be configured in vim...not an easy task.</p>
<p>I found configuring vim to be the most intimidating part of the experience. You basically have to write code to personalize your vim. This all happens in the vimrc file. Its blank when you start but allows you to add your settings and plugins for customization. Of course you dont have to touch your vimrc file to use vim but eventually you will want color, code highlighting, special formatting, and so on. This means you need to start adding plugins and learning how to add more functionality.</p>
<p>There are two approaches to customization. One is look up what you want and slowly build your vimrc. This way you know what you have and understand what you are doing. The other apprach is to just clone someone elses vimrc repo and voila its all configured. However, you will most likely have no clue what you have or be able to understand what is doing what. I was anxious to get my vim styled and looking purdy so I chose the latter to get me going. If you are interested in a great vim customized check out <a href="https://github.com/mcmire/vimfiles">Elliot Winkler's</a> git hub vim file repo.</p>

<p>Here are a few tools that will get you playing around with vim right away. I am using the built in vim 7.4 that comes with the Mac OS X 10.9. Start off by using Vimtutor. Its an interactive 20-30 minute tutorial that teaches you the fundamental commands and modes that you need for editing and navigating in vim. I found the vintutor to be very appraochable and easy to use. The interface of vimtutor is pretty plain and not exciting to look at but it is very user friendly and actually gets you to perform the commands. Vimtutor is essential for any beginner. To use vimtutor just type <em>vimtutor</em> in the command line. I was also shown an online vim game called <a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">Vim -Adventures</a> that was more visually stimulating than vimtutor. It's an online game that gets you practicing your vim commands. I spent about 20 minutes before I got bored but it was helpful for memorization of some very important key-bindings. After the vimtutor and vim adventures you will be ready to start editing.</p>

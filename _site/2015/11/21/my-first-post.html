<h1>My First Post</h1>
<p>November 21, 2015</p>
<p>Flying with the cheapest airline(Ryanair) in Europe isnt always the cheapest, especially if you arent paying attention.</p>
<p> <em>First assumption:</em> When we bought the tickets from Frankfurt, Germany to Zadar, Croatia we assumed we were flying from the Frankfurt Main airport. On the night before the departure our host family informed us that RyanAir has its own airport called Frankfurt Hahn some 40km outside of Frankfurt. It was a Sunday night and our flight was scheduled for 8am the next day. We then researched how to get to the airport - Prebooking a seat on a RyanAir bus from the Frankfurt Main airport. So we booked two seats for the bus (the cost for the bus was more than the plane tickets). Their website said to have your ticket printed before boarding the bus. However we never recieved an email with the confirmation or any documentation of our tickets. And because it was sunday night we had zero customer support. The bus we had to catch was leaving at 6am the next morning, so all we could do was show up the next morning and hope that the bus driver had a manifest of all paid passangers and that we would be on that list. Seems logical but it was not the case. Nevertheless the driver was happy to take our money for a new ticket. There was no margin of time to argue and based off the drivers gloomy attitude it would of been fruitless try. So we begrugendly paid twice for the tickets(now triple the cost of our plane tickets), in hopes that we could get reimbursed once we could talk to customer support. At this point we were just relieved to be on the bus and free from any doubt that we would miss our flight.</p>
<p><em>Second assumption:</em>When we arrived to the airport(in the middle of nowhere) we quickly got in line to check in our bags. We knew that checked bags are extra(almost double the cost of the plane ticket)so we were prepared to to pay the extra baggage fees. But we hadnt quite calculated the weight yet and knew we had to be under the required load or the fees are astronomical per kilo over. But we assumed that we could use the scales at the baggage check-in prior to actually checking in so that we could make sure we werent over the limit. What we discovered was that unless you are actually checking in with an agent you couldnt us the scales at the desk, they were turned off. Instead RyanAir provides an alternative - kind of like an arcade game, "cant play if you dont pay". The cost wasnt much but just out straight up annoying</p>
<p><em>Third assumption:</em>Now we are in line ready to check in and our bags all within the weight limit. While standing in line I started to calculate all the hidden costs we paid on top of the price of the plane ticket. We were still under the next cheapest Airline but still hadnt calculated the inconvienence of traveling an additonal 40km from the city. When we approached the desk the airline agent asked us for our boarding passes. We knew we had the option of printing them off before hand but we defaulted to getting them printed at the airport which was definitely on option when we purchased them online. The website explicitely said that if you do not have a copy of your boarding pass one will be printed for you. But it doesnt say that it will cost you 15 euro per passenger. I had to laugh sarcasticlly when he told us that. And ironically they had to get printed at the RyanAir help desk aka "the complaint desk". Perfect I thought, I have some complaints. But again I bet they charge per minute for that. So here we are again in line, recaulculating the hidden costs and still under the next cheapest airline but the hassles and stresses we went through we almost enough to justify the extra cost of flying with a hassle free airline</p>
<p><em>Fourth assumption:</em>All was water under the bridge when we finally arrived to Croatia. This was all new territory for us and so we really did not have any assumptions except that the weather will be hot and dry. Its practically the mediterranian and when I think about the mediterrainian I picture hot and dry. It was the beginning of May but that didnt stop us from ditching all of our layers back in Czech republic, we were hopeful. The weather was warmish but not hot when we arrived. There was actually a cool breeze coming off the sea. When we looked at the weather forcast for the coming week it wasnt what we wanted to see - cool and wet.</p>
<p>After dropping our packs at the first hostel we found, we went for a light stroll through the historic city of Zadar. The atmosphere was laidback and were gitty about our three week sailing adventure that was just around the corner. On top of the excitement we were in awe of our surroundings. It all felt so surreal. We walked along city walls with towers and gates, through polished lime stone streets and venician architecture. As we got deeper into the center, medieval looking churches and monistaries were revealed, as well as old Romanesque foundations still standing. Because the city lives on the Adriatic sea its has a history rich in sailers, mechants, and piracy. Since we were about to begin a sailing adventure it felt like we were starting in the right place. However, we still had a 160 miles hitchhiking journey south along the coast and a 3 hour ferry to the island of Lastovo where our sailing adventure will actually begin. We spent the rest of the day exploring the city and stocking up on supplies for our hitchhike south. Some of those supplies included extra warm clothes from a thrift shop.</p>
